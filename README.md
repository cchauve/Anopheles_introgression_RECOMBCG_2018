This repository contains the summary of the results described in the paper "Detecting introgression in Anopheles mosquito genomes using a reconciliation-based approach", to be published in the proceedings of RECOMB-CG 2018 (https://recombcg2018.usherbrooke.ca/)

The directory input contains the orhtogroups (gene families) and the results of the experiments done using MrBayes, ALE and MaxTiC.

The directory output contains the images and files generated by the two notebooks. 

The first notebook analyses the orthogroups and the inferred HGTs that define potential introgression events, as well as the results of MaxTiC on these HGTs.

The second notebook generates the chromoplots that shows genome regions with a higher than expect density of genes involved in specific HGTs.
